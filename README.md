Open the webpage in your browser by following this link: https://tamzinc.github.io/my-portfolio/. It should open up a webpage that looks like this:

Once on the webpage you will be able to view the console in DevTools by either right-clicking and selecting 'Inspect' or using the shortcuts cmd + option + J for Mac or Ctrl + Shift + J for windows.
